# This is a placeholder for a PNG image.
# In a real scenario, this would be binary data of a PNG.
# For the purpose of this tool, I'm creating a text file.
# If an actual image is needed, it would have to be downloaded or provided.
# A small, dark-themed background would be appropriate.
# Dimensions like 1024x768 or 1920x1080 are common for GRUB themes.
# Ensure it's optimized in size.
# For example, a simple gradient or a subtle logo.
# True binary content cannot be created with this tool.
