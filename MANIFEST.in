# Ensure woeusbgui is included if it's a script at that path.
# If it's part of the WowUSB package (e.g. WowUSB/gui.py with a main function),
# then entry_points in setup.py is the standard way to make it a script.
# This line might be redundant if setup.py handles it via `scripts` or `entry_points`.
