# WowUSB-DS9 Expedited Implementation Checklist (NTFS, exFAT, WinToGo)

This checklist focuses on the expedited implementation of NTFS, exFAT, and Windows To Go support for the initial release, planned for 2 weeks.

## Week 1: Filesystem and exFAT Support

### Day 1-2: exFAT Implementation
- [X] Add exFAT as filesystem option in CLI and GUI (core.py, gui.py)
- [X] Implement dependency checking for exFAT tools (filesystem_handlers.py)
- [X] Create exFAT formatting and validation functions (filesystem_handlers.py)
- [X] Develop UEFI boot support for exFAT (investigate UEFI:NTFS approach, filesystem_handlers.py, core.py)
- [ ] Test large file handling with exFAT (test scripts, manual tests)

### Day 3-4: NTFS Enhancements and UEFI:NTFS Integration
- [ ] Integrate UEFI:NTFS bootloader into package (core.py, data/)
- [ ] Implement improved NTFS validation checks (filesystem_handlers.py)
- [ ] Test NTFS bootability and UEFI:NTFS integration (test scripts, manual tests)

### Day 5: Refine Filesystem Handlers and Testing
- [ ] Review and optimize FatFilesystemHandler, NtfsFilesystemHandler, ExfatFilesystemHandler (filesystem_handlers.py)
- [ ] Implement basic test scripts for filesystem formatting and large file handling
- [ ] Manual testing of NTFS and exFAT support with large ISOs

## Week 2: Windows To Go and Documentation

### Day 6-7: Windows To Go Implementation
- [ ] Create Windows To Go specific partition layout (core.py, utils.py)
- [ ] Implement basic driver integration for portable Windows (core.py, workaround.py - research minimal drivers)
- [ ] Basic testing of Windows To Go creation and boot

### Day 8-9: Windows To Go Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Test Windows To Go boot across different hardware/VMs
- [ ] Refine Windows To Go implementation based on testing feedback

### Day 10: Documentation and Finalization
- [ ] Update ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, README-ENHANCED.md, ROADMAP.md
- [ ] Create initial release notes
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixing
- [ ] Prepare for initial release
- [ ] Update branding from WoeUSB to WowUSB throughout the codebase
